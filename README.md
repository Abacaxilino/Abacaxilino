### 👋 Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is **Gleidson Gonzaga**, but most people know me as **Zev**.  
It’s a long story involving many nicknames until this one stuck — and by now, it’s almost official.

I’m currently studying **Information Systems at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT)**, and if all goes well, I’ll graduate in **2029**.

I love working on personal projects and sparking new ideas to grow my own skills.  
You’ll often catch me online somewhere — whether it’s here on GitHub, hanging out on Discord, or dropping comments on AniList while watching anime.  
Most of the time, my learning process is built on curiosity, improvisation, and a bit of “let’s see what happens.”

### 🎲 A bit about me:
- Lover of RPGs, anime, and manga  
- Addicted to indie games and FPS (but honestly, I play a bit of everything)  
- I enjoy music in general, but I’ve got a soft spot for **Cowbell Funk** and **Memphis Rap**  
- I’ve got a knack for turning chaos into curiosity — and curiosity into creation

---

### 🧪 What you'll find here:
Most of my repositories are a work-in-progress — prototypes, experiments, and early versions of ideas I’m learning to shape and improve.  
Curious? Feedback is always welcome! ✌️
