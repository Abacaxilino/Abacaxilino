### 👋 Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is **Gleidson Gonzaga**, but most people know me as **Zev**.  
It’s a long story involving many nicknames until this one stuck — and by now, it’s almost official.

I’m currently studying **Information Systems at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT)**, and if all goes well, I’ll graduate in **2029**.
